ALGO
1. Connect & call both APIS
2. Set first statement of conversation
3. set repsonse from opposing person. 
4. repeat another 4 times
5. print conversation to console. 
Let’s create a console application that calls both the Ron Swanson API, and the Kanye West API. 

https://ron-swanson-quotes.herokuapp.com/v2/quotes

https://api.kanye.rest



Using both APIs, make Ron Swanson and Kanye West have a conversation
it should print to the console 
with at least 5 quotes 
and have them alternate to simulate a conversation



Hints:
Use a for loop to generate at least 5 quotes from each api and have them alternate to simulate a conversation

Here is some code to utilize for parsing the ron swanson response:

var ronQuote = JArray.Parse(ronResponse).ToString().Replace('[', ' ').Replace(']', ' ').Trim();
